# Sketch feature 


I'm using the VGG16 network from [tensorflow-vgg16](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg). Original Caffe implementation can be found in [here](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/211839e770f7b538e2d8) and [here](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/3785162f95cd2d5fee77).



You'll want to download the [vgg16 npy files](https://mega.nz/#!YU1FWJrA!O1ywiCS2IiOlUCtCpI6HTJOMrneN-Qdv3ywQP5poecM) to run the code.
